		<h5 id="down">Introduction: Design Methodology</h5>
		<h7>25.02.2019</h7>
		<h6><p>One of the main questions we discussed today was, How does one define ‘Interaction Design’? Coming from different perspectives and experiences, the responses were quite eye-opening. In regards to a more conceptual view, one would say much like Löwgren & Stoltermann in their text “Thoughtful Interaction Design”, that indeed Interaction Design is a wholesome concept that weighs on limitations or restrictions as a spark for creativity.</p>

		<p>"Interaction Design is the study of web-design, and app development." Is another popular answer that interaction designers usually resort to when asked about it by the general public. Its diversity and its interdisciplinary nature makes the subject difficult to describe to those without prior knowledge about the industry.</p>

		<p>How would you describe Interaction Design to a child? Simple. Talking toaster. I found this response to the question most memorable. Though a caricature, the statement provides a descriptive explaination, in that Interaction Design works with usability of objects and technology developments - thus the speech advancement of the everyday appliance. </p>

		<p>To continue, we reflected on our design process in our previous project, “Digital Fabrication”. The Excursive Method was also discussed as a concept of methodology. This method included stages of (respectively): Investigation, Play, Everyday, Tensions, Enactment, and Dissemination.</p>
