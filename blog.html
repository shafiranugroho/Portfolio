    <h5 id="down">Human-Computer Interaction & Methods</h5>
    <h7>18.03.2019</h7>
    <h6><p>Overtime ideal design methodologies have evolved, this includes the current paradigm from the classic ‘User-Centred Design’ to the more complex concept of ‘Co-Design’. The User-Centred design approach, is most known by many, and often includes an orderly work flow between users, researchers and designers. Though it might have worked for past design developments, our current situation demands advancements in more particular design fields that focuses on emotional needs, experiences, connecting cultures, etc. The concept of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is also an advanced design outlook, it can be defined as a competition between 3 paradigms: brains, tools and media. In short, as the design field continues to expand, it becomes more complex and requires support from more extensive methodologies. Thus comes the idea of Co-Design.</p>

    <p>Unlike the past’s more selective and consecutive methods, the Co-Design approach evolves around the idea of openness, community and intermediary relations. In this new approach, a diverse team (of designers, users, stakeholders, etc.) is encouraged to collaboratively ideate and develop design concepts. This method is also known as “Participatory Design”. The role of designers in such situations may also vary, as one can play the role of researcher, facilitator, innovator, specialist, or provocateur. </p>

    <p>The case study of Zurich Stadtforum, is one of the first local project that took on the Co-Design approach. Starting from 1997, 8 councils made of diverse representatives (including banks, businesses, experts, citizens, etc.) gathered for 10 meetings, in which they discuss the city planning for a certain area in Zurich City.</p>

    <center><img src="images/stadtforum.jpg" alt="Notes" /></center>

    <p>These so-called “open-meetings” was initiated in order to gather creative, varied, and overall balanced input. The nature of its method and team, the project resulted in the creation/development of a diverse area; evident it caring building sizes, businesses, people, etc. Though some may view its ’Open Start’ and ‘Open End’ approach successful, others argues its success. It is crucial to note, that overtime many of its public participants decreased; whether it be due to boredom or inclusive problems, many suggested other possibility of the Co-Design approach. One idea is to include public participation, not only through attendance in meetings, but also through probes. Much like the ‘Cultural Probes’ discussed in the text by Gaver, Dunne and Pacenti, such method is more interactive and can gain excellent personal information. Another way could also include through ethnographic videos. </p> </h6>

    <h5 id="down">Design in the Everyday</h5>
    <h7>11.03.2019</h7>
    <h6><p>Some may say that design is everywhere, but is design everything? And what purpose does it hold? In today’s discussion we looked at what makes a design process, and examples of domesticated design examples.
    </p>
    <p> To start, we were introduced to John M. Caroll, one of the earliest to study Human-Computer Interaction and minimalism in technology design. In Caroll’s book ‘Making Use’, he also noted 6 crucial characteristics and difficult properties of Design being:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Clarifying the problem </li>
      <li>Identifying/Planning design methods</li>
      <li>Illustrating the solution</li>
      <li>Reducing the design to wherewithal </li>
      <li>Integrating diverse knowledge and skills</li>
      <li>Anticipating its impact on the human activity</li>
    </ol>

    <p> The case study of De Laet and Mol’s essay on the Zimbabwe Bush Pump was also discussed in relation to Caroll’s guidelines. The Zimbabwe’s Bush Pump ‘B’ Type is known to be described as ‘fluid’ because of its physical design and due to the design process itself. Its creator, Dr. Morgan, was a firm believer in reduced/minimalistic design and sharing knowledge, and therefore gave away the plans of his idea as an open-sourced design for anyone to create with ease. Following its generous start, the design also required a particular design procedure known as ‘collaborative’ or ‘participatory’ design. Such methods of design requires a integration of diverse knowledge and skills. To begin, unlike many imported pumps, the Bush pump is created in Zimbabwe using local and sustainable materials. On a more social note, the installation of the pump also requires various skills such as the blessing of a ‘nganga’ (spiritual figure) and the community’s (women, men , children) team work when drilling the installation, as well as maintaining the conditions of the pump along the way. Last but most crucial is its anticipated impact on the human activity. Not only does the pump provides communities with water, sanitation and improve health conditions, but along with its installation the pump also builds nation. Since the text is arguably bias in its appraisal, we further questioned its method: </p>

    <p>In the case that the community participation fails, what becomes of the design’s success? At what stage should the community play their role in a participatory design?
    The earlier the better! Not to be mistaken with Dieter Rams’ suggestion to avoid having too many designers in one project, the collaborative design encourages team work between diverse knowledge and skills. </p>

    <h5 id="down">Perspectives of Design</h5>
    <h7>04.02.2019</h7>
    <h6><p>Looking back, we reflected on the timeline of 'Interaction Design', and how it is the way it is today. The discussion brings to perspective how humans and machines have developed and enriched experiences or ‘Interaction Design’ over time. Dating back to the industrial revolution, we reflected on the influential invention of the steam engine by James Watt in 1769. The impact of Trains were symbolic of growth of human interaction. Though it eased networking, communication, distribution of information, and made the world seemed smaller, it also painted the vision of individuals as part of a larger community.</p>

    <p>As the development of new technologies continued to perpetuate, the interest in the diffusion of these innovations came into demand. Thus the start of the ‘World Expo’ in 1851. The Expo gave nations the opportunity to exchange their newest technology advancements with one another. However it also subsequently ignited a sense of competition that accelerated the pace of innovation development and led to the start of trade and patent wars.</p>

    <p>Fast-forward the many creations that finally brought the first personal computer (PC) to the market in 1975. To further global networks and human interactions, the idea of the ‘Internet’ or the ‘World Wide Web’ (WWW) was born in 1989 by Sir Time Berners-Lee. Initially developed due to the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities around the world, the phenomena now reach the general public. </p>

    <p>With the world wide web made accessible to anyone with a PC, came the demand and creation of simple Graphic User Interface (GUI) and Infrastructures (Mouse, Modems, Fibre-optics, etc.). Microsoft and Apple were amongst the earliest companies to develop user-friendly operating systems like Windows and the MacOS. Early search engines were then developed by Yahoo, Altavista and Windows45; and later in 1998, Google created a more pronounced search engine.</p> 

    <p>In more recent times the development of IOT (Internet of Things) has also been in focus. The IOT is the concept of advancement of machine-to-machine interaction in order to improve human-to-human interaction! We then come to the discussion of Design in the Everyday, with subtopics of Computer Control, Computer Interface, Design Rules and Unruled, and Design Biased. We are exposed to Computer Control on the daily, whether it be in traffic lights or 3D-Printers. One of the earliest inventions of such system was founded by Basile Bouchon in 1725. Bouchon adapted the concept of the musical box and invented a way to control a loom with a perforated paper tape. Also known as the punch-card method, the system essentially bases on the idea of inserting a card into a machine that gives machine the working commands. This system was later developed by IBM into an early method of data storage used by early computers. As the one shift creates a rippling diffusion, so did the development of computer language, bringing us to the development of the G-Code used in 3D Printing.</p>

    <p>Computer Interface innovation is another on-going tech development. Many successful creations were birthed by Xerox Parc, MIT Media Lab, Media Lab Europe and Google Research. It’s also interesting to note the influence of metaphors of the everyday life in many of these innovations. Amongst many, include the trash and file icons on the desktop.</p>

    <p>Design Biased is another crucial point of discussion. Due to various reasons whether it be living conditions, upbringing, cultural background, we are indeed (subconsciously) biased thinkers. Car crash dummies, gender-based product marketing, and police vest are some amongst the many cases that highlights such bias and ignorance. And in many of these cases, such bias can dangerously influence one’s well-being/life. Take for example the car-crash dummies. These models have been built with a standard of a masculine figure. Unfortunately, since many car crash scenarios are based around these muscular-dummies, safety predictions are not tested for other genders or feminine-measurements. Thus, the unfortunate misaligned reality of safety, leading to worse chances of accidents for those without the ‘model’ measurements. Thus the emphasis on the importance of diversity in data collection and design teams in the design industry. </p>
    
    <p>Other honourable mentions include: the World Fairs and the ‘Whole Earth Catalogue’ and their role in enhancing interactions, inventions like the PC around the 80’s that subsequently birthed advancements in GUI, Navigators, Search Engines, Infrastructure, etc. and the more known IOT, Mobile Phones and Social Media. Starting from the origin of the ‘Internet’ and the invention of the ’World Wide Web’ by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. What was initially developed due to the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities around the world, the phenomena now reach the general public. </p>

		<h5 id="down">Deconstructing Interaction Design</h5>
		<h7>25.02.2019</h7>
		<h6><p>One of the main questions we discussed today was, How does one define ‘Interaction Design’? Coming from different perspectives and experiences, the responses were quite eye-opening. In regards to a more conceptual view, one would say much like Löwgren & Stoltermann in their text “Thoughtful Interaction Design”, that indeed Interaction Design is a wholesome concept that weighs on limitations or restrictions as a spark for creativity.</p>

      <center><img src="images/design1.png" alt="Notes" /></center>

		<p>"Interaction Design is the study of web-design, and app development." Is another popular answer that interaction designers usually resort to when asked about it by the general public. Its diversity and its interdisciplinary nature makes the subject difficult to describe to those without prior knowledge about the industry.</p>

		<p>How would you describe Interaction Design to a child? Simple. Talking toaster. I found this response to the question most memorable. Though a caricature, the statement provides a descriptive explaination, in that Interaction Design works with usability of objects and technology developments - thus the speech advancement of the everyday appliance. </p>

		<p>To continue, we reflected on our design process in our previous project, “Digital Fabrication”. The Excursive Method was also discussed as a concept of methodology. This method included stages of (respectively): Investigation, Play, Everyday, Tensions, Enactment, and Dissemination.</p>
