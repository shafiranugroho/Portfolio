      <h5>| Abstract </h5>
      <h6>
        <p>Imagine it’s just a normal day at the Living Museum. Whether you go to the toilet, the
          upper workshops, the offices or the coffee shop, you can’t miss the farbaeder. At this
          point, where we are standing right now, everyone passes by. Visitors, artists and workers
          from the Ateliers – Living Museum become a part of the installation.
          The farbaeder speaks for itself and it is easy to understand how it works. Intuitively one
          reaches for a colored module and places it on the platform, thereby sending a brief expression.
          Meanwhile something exciting happens. This expression reaches the monitor
          in digital form and changes the previous image which is created by the previous participants.
          At this moment, the indirect and collaborative creation of art begins, in which
          each person gives something of themselves and become part of a whole. In this way, a
          work is created through indirect collaboration.</p>
        <p>This open and flexible installation embodies collaboration and enables a different kind
          of communication. A nonverbal one.</p>

      <h5>| Participatory Journey </h5>
      <h6>
        <p>Over the past 6 weeks we as students from Interaction Design second semester had
          the opportunity to create a 6 week project with a real life partner during our «Design
          Process» module: The psychiatric clinic in Wil called the «Ateliers Living Museum». The
          goal of the course was to use different design methods - such as participatory design
          and design ethnography - to create an artefact that is created «with people, for the
          people, by the people». We found each other as a group of four people (Sonjoi Nielsen,
          Shafira Nugroho, Sophie Anderhub, Yangzom Sharlhey) after a rapid brainstorming
          where we all showed interest in the topic of communication between the people of the
          «Ateliers Living Museum».</p>
        <p>* Sidenote:
          As we don’t like the expression of «patients» in the context of an atelier museum, we decided
          to call the participants of our project nothing less than artists, because that’s what
          they are.</p>

          <h6>
            We had really personal conversations where
            both parties told about personal information
            and we started to build relations. We met many
            motivated people who and reveived many desires
            and ideas.

              <p>We made a participatory circuit with 3 stations: Fimo, LEGO and Drawing. Each station
                had a question that had to be answered with a material. After 15 minutes, the participants
                changed stations and continued to work on the existing works of art. The round
                ends after one whole tour.</p>
              <p> We think that the LEGO version worked well
                because it’s modular, you can’t make any mistakes
                and it has a nostalgic meaning to the
                participants.</p>

                <p>Our mock-up followed the 'Wizard of Oz' process and was built from a styrofoam base
                  plate with cubes of different colors which can be
                  plugged in. As the output, we used a visualizer where two of us were present and faked

                  We tested the pock-up in the field and got some first reactions out of it. We still had to
                  fake the colour output, as it was built out of styrofoam. People were very curious and participated
                  in our pock-up. They also already started
                  to interpret the output on the screen that we
                  faked with water.We still thought that the affordance of the
                  modules weren’t clear enough as the modules
                  were made out of styrofoam and still very
                  abstract. The live output fascinated each participant
                  and some people even chose the modules
                  because of colours.

                    In our cultural probe we gave the artists a camera with which they had to take pictures
                    of the colour of an object which describes it best. We called it «Farbfänger». We had 7 participants who took all of the 10
                    fotos. We actually discovered that there was no pattern
                    of how people feel about colours and every
                    person interpreted them individually.

      <h6>
        During the production week we worked a lot on our code for the colour recognition and
        we also constructed and printed all of the modules via a 3D printer. We created a technical
        working prototype and evolved our modules over and over again. We all put a lot of
        effort into the production and worked hard.

      <h5>| Final Prototype in Wil </h5>
      <h6>
        As one of our final steps, we placed and
        tested our prototype on-site - the Art Living
        Museum in Wil. Our intentions were
        to evaluate how our targeted-users interact
        with the device as well as observe
        its impact in connecting people, encourage
        collaboration and start conversations.
        This was encouraged through playful
        user-testing and talk-aloud methods. The
        outcome was rich in emotional and sincere
        responses and many noted their interest
        in both the physicality of device and the
        technical aspects too! It interest us most
        to see how comfortable the users. Some
        were more busy with the input modules,
        some more with the output screen. It was
        really great to see how they reacted to different
        senses such as hearing, touching
        and seeing.

      <h5>| Make & Share Art Live from Wherever! </h5>
      <h6>
        <p>In extension of our device, and our motive
          to encourage collaborative work through
          connecting-spaces, two other outcomes
          finalized our idea.
          This was achieved by creating a simple-physical-
          button and a live-website that is connected
          with the local device, which then with a clickof-
          a-button refreshes its live feed and publishes
          the most recent art works.
          The website <a href="http://farbaeder.com/index.html">www.farbaeder.com</a> also has a
          gallery-page that collects and archives published
          works, which one can download and/or request
          personalized postcards to be made. The
          idea of postcards also encourages communication
          and supports the idea of togetherness
          despite distance.</p>

        <p>Our screen was placed in the same space
          as the input device, therefore we wish for
          the future that the output screen would
          be put in other rooms or even in another
          country like the «Ateliers Living Museum»
          in New York.</p>
