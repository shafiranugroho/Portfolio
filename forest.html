      <h5>| The Goal </h5>
      <h6>
        <p>Based on the paper “The Global Tree Restoration Potential" by Tom Crowther in 2019
          and other information provided by the lab, we designed a playful approach for people
          to receive more information about climate change and what positive impact one newly
          planted tree could have. The design is made for a 65’ screen which will be placed in
          an exhibition like a table, as well as IR tracking devices, with which visitors can play
          and interact seperately yet simulataneously.</p>
        Through them and a lot of researching, we gained more information about the topic of climate change and trees. We wanted to focus on the following five key points.
        <ul>
          <li>Facts and Figures</li>
          <li>Carbon Sequestration</li>
          <li>Biomes</li>
          <li>Projects</li>
          <li>Worldwide</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Subsequently covering key messages encouraged by the <a href="https://www.crowtherlab.com/">Crowther Lab</a> for us to cover which are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Forests play a huge role in regulating the climate</li>
          <li>The climate is changing - if we continue business as usual, the area of the world’s forests will shrink.</li>
          <li>Increasing forest cover will be a critical tool in combating climate change. (We estimate 0.9 billion hectares can drawdown 2/3’s of anthropogenic carbon in the atmosphere.)</li>
          <li>There are many other benefits to a forest - it’s not just about carbon drawdown but also air filtration, water cleanliness, wider biodiversity.</li>
          <li>There are many ways for citizens to get involved - restore, fund, invest responsibly.</li>
        </ul>

      <h5>| Prototyping </h5>
      <h6>
        Our Prototype includes three layers, the globe,
        the projects and the questions. Through this we could implement different
        information over some simple interactions and provide a lot of knowledge
        at once. Those layers are made visible through three different tokens which
        are represented by a globe, a tree and a cloud.

            First digital prototype; it shows the different token on the side of the
            table as well the globe, which is always visible on the screen.
            Every token has it’s own purpose but mainly works the same. While people
            may place the token in various spots on the screen the information will
            adapt accordingly. They can approache the table in every state and still
            have access to everything, there is no beginning or end.

              We chose a globe, a tree and a cloud to represent the three
              layers figurativly. For the globe, a globe fited perferct as the
              visitor can hold the world in its own hand and “play god” through
              changing the worldview. For the projects, a tree represents the
              many trees which have and will be planted by people helping
              reforestating certain areas. For the questions, a cloud betokens
              the CO2 as well the data collected through the Crowther Lab stored
              in the cloud.

                An integradet sensor tracks the devices on the screen through
                a camera installed on the ceiling. Because of this connection,
                information can be shown on the display and visitor have a chance
                to play and learn something new.

        If the globe-token will be placed on the screen, information
        about the given map will appear next to it. Those information
        show the average temparature, average CO2 in the atmosphere and
        aswell stored in trees worldwide. Bars curved around the globe
        make those numbers more relatable. By rotating the token, the map
        on the globe can be changed and the bars will change accordingly.
        There are three different maps available

            The bars around the globe represent three different information about the currently visible map. Red stands for the average temperature worldwide in C° (celcius), brown for the average amount of carbon stored in the forests in gT
            (gigaton) and the light blue shows the average CO2 in the atmosphere in ppm (parts per million). It is possible to zoom in at the different maps to look at various region more precisely.

        If the tree-token will be placed on the screen, information about NGO’s in different biomes appeare. As it is an addaptive layout it is not important where visitor choose to place the token.
        By rotating the tree-token people can browse through the projects. Following the red line to the globe one can find the place of the projects on the world. Every project and its diverse biom is illustrated in an isometric view. By sliding the
        bar on the bottom of the illustration, visitor can slide through time and see the difference the work can make. Around the illustration are a QR-Code linked to the NGO’s website and various pictures which show the current situation in those
        areas. By clicking on them they grow and visitors can have a better look at it.

            With the third token, the cloud-token, placed on the table, visitors gain access to knowledge through questions in a playful way. They can learn new things about the climate and tree, correlated to their own way of living.
            By rotating the token people can browse through different questions. It is not important where to start. Peoplecan enter their answers with a bar and afterwards tap on the “show answer” button for the result. Every question is providing
            information about the important topic of reforestation and should guide people in a playful way.
