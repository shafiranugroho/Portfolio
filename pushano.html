      <h5>| Ideation & Brainstorming </h5>
      <h6>
        Our ideas derived from inspirations such as Heider &
        Simmel’s infamous animation of personified geometry
        shapes, as well as Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby’s
        Technological Dreams Series. In both cases, empathy
        essentially grew through the robots’ movement. To
        create an empathetic robot in such simplicity, with
        forms far from “humanoid” really intrigued us. This
        brought us to look further into textures, light and
        especially sorts of movements that triggers a sense of
        empathy.
        As our first task, we decided to settle in creating a
        curious, cheeky, and slightly shy when confronted
        robot. However, it was challenging for us to set
        functionality for an empathetic robot.

        After re-evaluation, we set ourselves on a
        direction, which brought us to the beginning of
        ‘Pushano’ — a robot that appreciates hygiene and order
        in its surrounding, with foreign objects in its sight,
        it acts enraged and pushes it off its periphery.
        Inspired by a common problem around our atelier -
        Pushano is the guardian of the tables, clearing the
        tables of trash left by strangers.

      <h5>| Realizing the Idea </h5>
      <h6>
        A big part of this project was realising our ideation
        of Pushano in terms of its technicality.
        Inexperienced, we prioritised to plan and test the
        set-up of the code in response to the Arduino’s input
        and output. The final circuit combines the Ultrasonic
        sensor, Infrared sensor, and one Servo Motor. This
        section of the project was rather tricky as physical
        aspects (ie. physical arm/pusher and weight of
        materials) had critical impact on the circuit and
        code, we had to find the balance between the two
        natures. This involved many cases of the trial and
        error approach.

      <h5>| The Form </h5>
      <h6>
        Quick & Dirty Prototyping - Before we proceeded in creating a form
        with final and refund materials, we
        created a quick, yet scaled, prototype
        of potential set-up using cardboard.
        This allowed us to think of the set-up
        and placement of the different contents
        connected within the circuit. Another
        focus was on the aesthetics of the skin
        in terms of texture to evoke a
        particular character of tough, anger,
        frustration and fury.

      <h5>| Conclusion & Evalutaion </h5>
      <h6>
        <p>— The program worked, fully supported the body and performed actions and
          reactions as planned. The whole physical computing was rather a tricky
          process. As not only were there complications in the development of the code/
          program and the physical body of the robot individually, but problems in on
          particular aspect could result complications in both. Everything had to be
          calculated and balanced.</p>
        <p> — Smaller form could be developed. More precisely produced circuit, by
          creating a customised, soldered, and milled PCB.</p>
        <p>— It has been a lesson learnt, to always save and push progress made on the
          code directly onto Github. This way, it is easier to find and reverse changes
          made along the trial & error process</p>
