  		<h5>|  Who do I design for? </h5>
  		<h6>Designed particularly for Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), the app presents a great sense of school spirit through choices of color, typography and other graphics. Though the app could possibly be used by faculty members too, the design is mainly targeted for ZHdK’s college students. In light of this, features offered are tailored and simplified for the targeted end user. Nonetheless, depending on the type of students, support and solutions needed may vary. To further understand the problem and provide sustainable solutions, I interviewed five ZHdk students with various backgrounds in age, gender, major, and type of student.

    		<h5>|  Branding </h5>
    		<h6>After further user and product research, the decision was made to create a solely, school based app as it is found most efficient for users’ experience. Not only are students familiar with the “brand”, but also, since it allows the app to be connected to other school platforms/intranet, it offers an abundance of user profiles to cater to the recommendation feature. In this brand study, the school’s spirit or brand identity was analyzed through its current website, intranet, magazine, posters, etc. The brand study concluded that the school, despite its simplistic nature, has  indeed a strong visual identity. This is evident through its constant use of primary color pop, likes of asymmetry, and mixtures of organic analog and structured digital features.

        <h5>|  User Research </h5>
        <h6>Below are a few user-flow diagrams that maps and aims to solve the noted problems from user research. These include, but not limited to, how a new user can login and manage event on calendar, how to choose prefered event and navigate way towards it, how to personalize experience through taking the questionnaire, how to stay alert and view notifications, etc.

        <h5>|  The Z-Code & AR Map </h5>
        <h6>The Z-Code is a featured graphics concept based on the existing QR-Code concept. Such concepts are used in many apps like Snapchat and WhatsApp, etc. It offers users to add another through scanning the code. The feature is added in this app, simply to encourage its users to build real-world connections. Being the only other way to add/follow another person (the first connection/following is automatically generated once user connects with school login - adding classmates and faculty). the feature also provides users with a sense of security and boundary. Inspired by Google Map’s  latest AR navigation concept, the app hopes to also implement such features in order to enhance the user’s experience. This solves the problem for those unfamiliar with the area by visually signaling their live path towards the event.

        <h5>|  Conclusion </h5>
        <h6>Although the current app only provides and is specifically designed for ZHdK students, the basis of the app can be used for various communities and could expand to broader markets. Acting as a sort of ‘middle man’ between users and event organizers, the app offers and is responsible for its authenticity and security. It may also focus on other, more advanced, areas such as impeccable recommendation system and implementing AR to maps to enhance its users’ experience. The concept is simple, spirited and full of potential!
